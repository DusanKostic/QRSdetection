Working with Cell Notation
==========================

XlsxWriter supports two forms of notation to designate the position of cells:
**Row-column** notation and **A1** notation.

Row-column notation uses a zero based index for both row and column while A1
notation uses the standard Excel alphanumeric sequence of column letter and
1-based row. For example::


    (0, 0)      # Row-column notation.
    ('A1')      # The same cell in A1 notation.

    (6, 2)      # Row-column notation.
    ('C7')      # The same cell in A1 notation.

Row-column notation is useful if you are referring to cells programmatically::

    for row in range(0, 5):
        worksheet.write(row, 0, 'Hello')

A1 notation is useful for setting up a worksheet manually and for working with
formulas::

    worksheet.write('H1', 200)
    worksheet.write('H2', '=H1+1')

In general when using the XlsxWriter module you can use A1 notation anywhere
you can use row-column notation::

    # These are equivalent.
    worksheet.write(0, 7, 200)
    worksheet.write('H1', 200)

.. note::
   In Excel it is also possible to use R1C1 notation. This is not
   supported by XlsxWriter.

The ``XlsxWriter`` ``utility`` contains several helper functions for dealing
with A1 notation, for example::

    from utility import xl_cell_to_rowcol, import xl_rowcol_to_cell

    (row, col) = xl_cell_to_rowcol('C2')  # -> (1, 2)
    string     = xl_rowcol_to_cell(1, 2)  # -> C2


Relative and absolute cell references in Excel
----------------------------------------------

Cell references in Excel can be either relative or absolute. Absolute
references are prefixed by the dollar symbol as shown below::

    A1      # Column and row are relative.
    $A1     # Column is absolute and row is relative.
    A$1     # Column is relative and row is absolute.
    $A$1    # Column and row are absolute.

An absolute reference only makes a difference if the cell is copied. TODO...


xl_rowcol_to_cell()
-------------------

.. py:function:: xl_rowcol_to_cell(row, col[, row_abs, col_abs])

   Convert a zero indexed row and column cell reference to a A1 style string.

   :param int row:      The cell row.
   :param int col:      The cell column.
   :param bool row_abs: Optional flag to make the row absolute.
   :param bool col_abs: Optional flag to make the column absolute.
   :rtype:              A1 style string.


The ``xl_rowcol_to_cell()`` function converts a zero indexed row and column
cell values to an ``A1`` style string::

    cell = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 0)   # A1
    cell = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 1)   # B1
    cell = xl_rowcol_to_cell(1, 0)   # A2

The optional parameters ``row_abs`` and ``col_abs`` can be used to indicate
that the row or column is absolute::

    str = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 0, col_abs=True)                # $A1
    str = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 0, row_abs=True)                # A$1
    str = xl_rowcol_to_cell(0, 0, row_abs=True, col_abs=True)  # $A$1
